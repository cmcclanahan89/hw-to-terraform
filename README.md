# hw-to-terraform

This is a personal project to help me learn more Go. I want this module to scan a machine, gather information, convert it automatically to a terraform file that I could use for a direct lift and shift of on-prem hardware to the cloud. I know its not best practice to lift and shift, this is just a learning project.
