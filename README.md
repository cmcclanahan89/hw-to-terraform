# hw-to-terraform

This is a personal project to help me learn more Go and hopefully transition to a SRE or Devops position. 

I want this module:
- To scan a machine (either unix or Windows) 
- Gather information. IE Hostname, Architecture, RAM amount etc

With the information I want to:
- Use the collected information to generate IaC files for cloud deployment. 
- Do differnt types of IaC, either Terraform or Bicep.
